# My Puja Website
A full stack web app with organized directory of events / pujas and livestreams directed toward Hindu temple-goers, specifically patrons of the Toronto Kalibari temple.

## Check out the website!
Since this is a working website made as a personal project for a temple, it can be found here: https://my-puja-production.web.app/events

## Project Info

### Frontend
The frontend uses React.JS for the website. A native version may be coming soon.
### Backend
The backend uses Firebase's Cloud Firestore to store all events / pujas in an orderly fashion.
